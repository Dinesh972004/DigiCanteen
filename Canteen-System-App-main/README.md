# Canteen System App

The Canteen Management System offers menu management and order placement. Only authorized users can update the menu by adding or removing items. Each menu modification is instantly reflected in the database, ensuring real-time synchronization of menu details. On the other hand, customers can access the system through an app to place orders conveniently.
